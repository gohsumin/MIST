### **The Mathematical Images Synthesis Toolkit**

_This branch is the last commit to which I contributed!_

In the summer of 2020, I was a research assistant in this Mentored Advancement Project, and I was immediately fascinated by MIST's intersection of art, CS, and math.

Our 2020 team's task was to re-create the [MIST website from 2014](https://mist.sites.grinnell.edu/create).

We were a team of ten, and with little instruction but to work together respectfully (which was a valuable experience for me), we organized ourselves into groups by tasks/interest and got to work. During the 10-week period of the MAP, I pair-programmed every day with a teammate to re-create the **workspace**, using React and Konva.

I continued the MAP as an on-campus job in the fall of 2020, and last summer, another MAP team worked on it (hence the additional commits in the main branch).

### To view the workspace (where I last left off):
- clone repo
- run yarn & npm start from the frontend folder
- check out http://localhost:3000/createWorkspace !
